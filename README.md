Test Mail Server Tool is a full featured mail (SMTP) server emulation to test mail sending capabilities of a web or desktop application or to preview messages before they are actually sent. This is a great tool for web programmers or application developers who need mail server for tests but don't want to install one.

The program listens on localhost on a SMTP port (usually 25, may be changed). All mail sent to this tool is automatically stored and optionally opened with your mail client.

Points of interest:

Web developers -- test and debug mail sending features of your web site.
Desktop application developers -- test, debug, preview messages sent by your program.
Office managers -- preview messages before sending it to clients and colleagues.
Other users -- add mail preview feature to any program.
Other benefits are streamlined install, ease of use, small size, and easy uninstall. One of the important things is that this edition of Test Mail Server Tool is free.
